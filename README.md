# Fake-news-detection
To save todayâ€™s internet users from the plight of misinformation , our project approaches to develop a machine learning model (LSTM) that also includes the concept of web scrapping and thus would help user to determine whether the information they are going through is fake or real just by inputting either the text, image or URLs. My team developed a machine learning tool that would classify real and fake news as per the user input. Using evaluation.py our user will give input to the model and our model will do the prediction. The model will tell the user whether the text that the user input or the text directed by the link input by the user is real or fake news. The model will also display the number of real and fake images in the page directed by the link and which of them are real and fake.
